TO RUN THIS PROJECT, USE NPM INSTALL and NPM RUN DEV !

I chose to use sass for this project because the way of nesting style elements reminds me of conventional programming, nevertheless I notice that for a component with a lot of "child" styles, it can quickly become confusing, the main thing is to keep some consistency in the class names.
I didn't use the others because the css in js is a nonsense for me, I think you have to keep the logic, the semantics and the style in separate files
